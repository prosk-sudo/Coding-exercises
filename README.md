# Coding-exercises

I upload my solutions for coding exercises from various websites, along with
files from the books I use to learn programming languages.

The solutions I post are generally not the optimised versions; they are the
version that were accepted, although I may have made some modifications to
improve their performance.

P.S. I am a beginner coder, so the general difficulty of the problems is
between 1~2 out of 10.
