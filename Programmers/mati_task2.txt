You are given a string `my_string` and a 2D integer array `queries`
as parameters. Each element in `queries` is in the form `[s,e]`, meaning
you should reverse the substring of `my_string` from index `s` to index `e`.

Write a function `solution` that processes the commands in `queries` in order
and returns the resulting string after all operations.

Constraints:
    my_string is only composed of lowercase English letters.
    1 <= len(my_string) <= 1,000
    0 <= s <= e < len(my_string)
    1 <= len(queries) <= 1,000

Input 1:
    my_string = "rermgorpsam"
    queries = [[2, 3], [0, 7], [5, 9], [6, 10]]

Output 1:
    "programmers"
